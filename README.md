Rails Content Assist Plugin for Eclipse Orion
=============================================

The goal of this plugin is to add Ruby on Rails specific content assist for the Orion editor.
Hopefully it will facilitate working on Ruby on Rails projects with Orion.
See [http://wiki.eclipse.org/Orion](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Orion) for more information about Orion.
